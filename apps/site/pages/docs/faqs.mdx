# Frequently asked questions

## What is ETS?
ETS or Ethereum Tag Service is a decentralized tagging service built as a
drop-in replacement or implementation for third-party services (dApps,
platforms, applications, smart contracts) that are actively tagging or
considering tagging content.

## Why use ETS?
Our solution will replace centralized infrastructure, simplify & automate
tagging, increase customer engagement and generate additional revenue streams.

## Is ETS a DAO?
Not yet.

## Is ETS open source?
Not yet.

## Does ETS have a token?
Sort of. The tags themselves are ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (ETSTAG). We
are also exploring issuing a utility token ($ETST).

## How is this different from ENS?
ENS (or Ethereum Name Service) is used for registering
one-to-one relationships between a name and an address. ETS is a tagging service
more appropriate for registraton of high-volume, many-to-many tag-to-target
relationships.

## How does ETS work?

## Isn't ETS just rent seeking?
Quite the opposite. We envision a paradigm shift where tags and the tagging
social graph are mediated by a decentralized crypto-economic network rather than
a few central authorities.

The result will be a global information architecture that is more freely and
efficiently accessed than today and an unlocking of value presently siloed,
obscured and monopolized in a few centralized social networks.

More specifically, minting an ETSTAG does not mean you own it.
ETSTAGS are released for auction thus giving the market the opportunity to place a
value on it. ETSTAG creators are, however, given a portion of the origin
auction sale price if they choose not to purchase their creation.
