## Overview

![Hello](/ets-application-flow.png)

The core of ETS is a set of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible smart
contracts.

The centerpiece is a public tagging API that takes as arguments a digital
artifact identifier, rerred to as a "target", a tag (utf-8 ascii string), a
Publisher address and a Tagger address.

The transaction cost is made up of the gas plus a small ETS service fee. The wallet address paying for the transaction
is recognized as the Sponsor.

When called, the tagging function checks if a tag (itself an NFT) exists for the
hashtag string. If it does, a reference between the tag and the target is
written to the blockchain. If no tag exists, a new one is minted and then the
new tag x target reference is written to the blockchain. Also stored in the
tagging record is the Publisher address and the Tagger Address. The entire
tagging event is indexed by The Graph.

Inside a newly minted tag token (which can also be minted on their own using a
public mint function) are recorded the hashtag string, the Publisher address,
and the address that paid the transaction fee, referred to as the “Creator”.
Ownership of the tag is retained by ETS until released to the market for
auction. If purchased at auction, the proceeds are divided among the Publisher,
the Creator and ETS.

Being an open system, ETS places no restrictions on tags or targets: Any whitelisted Publisher may tag any target with any tag. When successfully executed, the ETS tagging fee is split and accrued to the wallets of the original tag Publisher, the tag Creator (or Owner if it has been purchased), and ETS.
